# Netflix Clone App
I have cloned Netflix using the power of Firebase and the TMDB API, creating an immersive streaming platform that offers a similar experience to the popular streaming service. 

By integrating Firebase, I have built a robust backend infrastructure that handles user authentication, data storage, and real-time updates. Users can create accounts, securely log in, and enjoy a personalized streaming experience. Firebase's scalability ensures that the platform can handle a growing user base seamlessly.

The integration of the TMDB API brings a vast library of movies and TV shows to the platform. Users can browse through a wide range of content, access detailed information about each title, and even watch trailers. The TMDB API also provides data such as ratings, genres, and release dates, enriching the browsing experience and enabling users to discover new content easily.

To enhance the viewing experience, I have implemented features like dynamic searching, trending content, and personalized recommendations based on user preferences and viewing history. The platform is designed with a sleek and intuitive user interface, making it easy for users to navigate and enjoy their favorite shows and movies.

Overall, this Netflix clone powered by Firebase and the TMDB API delivers a seamless and engaging streaming experience, offering a diverse selection of content and personalized recommendations for users to enjoy.
